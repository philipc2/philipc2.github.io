## About

I'm a **Scientific Software Engineer** with the [GeoCAT](https://geocat.ucar.edu/) team at the [NSF National Center for Atmospheric Research](https://ncar.ucar.edu/), where I develop [UXarray](https://github.com/UXARRAY/uxarray), a Python library designed for analyzing and visualizing unstructured-grid datasets.

My work centers on harnessing Python's versatility in scientific computing to enable sophisticated analyses without sacrificing performance. By integrating modern, high-performance libraries such as Numba, Dask, and CuPy, as well as targeted extensions written in C++ and CUDA, I create intuitive, scalable Python APIs suitable for environments ranging from individual workstations to high-performance computing clusters.

Collaboration is fundamental to my approach; I partner directly with engineers, researchers, and domain experts to bridge scientific rigor with robust software engineering practices. My primary objective is to translate complex geoscientific challenges into accessible, user-focused toolsâ€”streamlining data ingestion, enhancing analytical capabilities, and facilitating interactive visualizations so researchers can concentrate fully on their discoveries.
