## About

I’m a **Scientific Software Engineer** on the [GeoCAT](https://geocat.ucar.edu/) team at the [NSF National Center for Atmospheric Research](https://ncar.ucar.edu/). I work on [UXarray](https://github.com/UXARRAY/uxarray), a Python package for analysis and visualization of unstructured-grid datasets.

By partnering directly with scientists and engineers, I translate geoscience challenges into intuitive software interfaces. My user-focused abstractions, from streamlined data ingestion to interactive visualization, remove boilerplate so researchers can concentrate on discovery.

I modernize legacy workflows without compromising speed. Leveraging Numba, Dask, CuPy, and targeted C++/CUDA integrations, I deliver high-level Python APIs that scale from local workstations to HPC systems.

I believe that interdisciplinary collaboration among engineers, researchers, and domain scientists is crucial for bridging deep scientific expertise with robust software engineering, ensuring the tools we build truly address real-world research needs.

I’m passionate about Python’s role in scientific computing: making advanced analysis accessible without sacrificing performance by harnessing optimized libraries and targeted native extensions.
