## About

I’m a **Scientific Software Engineer** on the [GeoCAT](https://geocat.ucar.edu/) team at the [NSF National Center for Atmospheric Research](https://ncar.ucar.edu/). I work on [UXarray](https://github.com/UXARRAY/uxarray), a Python package for analysis and visualization of unstructured-grid datasets.


I’m passionate about Python’s role in scientific computing: making advanced analysis accessible without sacrificing performance by harnessing optimized libraries and targeted native extensions. I modernize legacy workflows without compromising speed by leveraging Numba, Dask, CuPy, and targeted C++/CUDA integrations, delivering high-level Python APIs that scale from local workstations to HPC systems.

By partnering directly with engineers, researchers, and domain scientists, I foster interdisciplinary collaboration to bridge scientific expertise with robust software engineering, translating geoscience challenges into intuitive, user-focused abstractions (from streamlined data ingestion to interactive visualization) that remove boilerplate and ensure our tools address real-world research needs so scientists can concentrate on discovery.
