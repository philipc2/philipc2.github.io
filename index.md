## About

I'm a **Scientific Software Engineer** with the [GeoCAT](https://geocat.ucar.edu/) team at the [NSF National Center for Atmospheric Research](https://ncar.ucar.edu/), where I develop [UXarray](https://github.com/UXARRAY/uxarray), a Python library designed for analyzing and visualizing unstructured-grid datasets.

My work centers on harnessing Python's versatility in scientific computing to enable sophisticated analyses without sacrificing performance. By integrating modern, high-performance libraries such as Numba, Dask, and CuPy, as well as targeted extensions written in C++ and CUDA, I create intuitive, scalable Python APIs suitable for environments ranging from individual workstations to high-performance computing clusters.

Collaboration is central to my approach. I partner closely with engineers, researchers, and domain experts, effectively bridging scientific rigor with robust software engineering. My primary goal is to transform complex geoscientific challenges into accessible, user-centric tools, simplifying data ingestion and enabling interactive visualizations, allowing researchers to fully focus on discovery.
