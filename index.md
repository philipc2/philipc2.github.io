## About

Iâ€™m a **Scientific Software Engineer** on the [GeoCAT](https://geocat.ucar.edu/) team at the [NSF National Center for Atmospheric Research](https://ncar.ucar.edu/). I develop [UXarray](https://github.com/UXARRAY/uxarray), a Python package for analysis and visualization of unstructured-grid datasets.

By partnering directly with scientists and engineers, I translate geoscience challenges into intuitive software interfaces. My user-focused abstractions, from streamlined data ingestion to interactive visualization, remove boilerplate so researchers can concentrate on discovery.

I modernize legacy workflows without compromising speed. Leveraging Numba, Dask, CuPy, and targeted C++/CUDA integrations, I deliver high-level Python APIs that scale from local workstations to HPC systems.
