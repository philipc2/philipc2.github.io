## About

I’m a **Scientific Software Engineer** on the [GeoCAT](https://geocat.ucar.edu/) team at the [NSF National Center for Atmospheric Research](https://ncar.ucar.edu/), developing [UXarray](https://github.com/UXARRAY/uxarray), a Python library for analyzing and visualizing unstructured-grid datasets.

I’m passionate about leveraging Python’s versatility in scientific computing, enabling advanced analyses without compromising performance. By modernizing legacy workflows using optimized libraries such as Numba, Dask, and CuPy alongside targeted C++ and CUDA integrations, I deliver intuitive Python APIs designed to scale seamlessly from local workstations to HPC clusters.

I foster interdisciplinary collaboration by partnering directly with engineers, researchers, and domain scientists, bridging deep scientific expertise with robust software engineering. My goal is always to translate complex geoscience challenges into user-centric tools, streamlining data ingestion, analysis, and interactive visualization, so researchers can focus purely on discovery.
