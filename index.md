## About

I’m a **Scientific Software Engineer** on the GeoCAT team at the NSF National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). I develop **UXarray**, a package for seamless analysis and visualization of unstructured‐grid datasets directly from climate models.

My passion lies at the intersection of geoscience and cutting-edge computing. I work extensively with:

- **High-resolution unstructured grids** from modern climate and weather models  
- **Python acceleration** using Numba, NumPy, Dask, and CuPy  
- **HPC languages and frameworks**, including C++, CUDA, OpenMP, and MPI
