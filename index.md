## About


Iâ€™m a **Scientific Software Engineer** on the [GeoCAT](https://geocat.ucar.edu/) team at the [NSF National Center for Atmospheric Research](https://ncar.ucar.edu/). I develop [UXarray](https://github.com/UXARRAY/uxarray), a Python package for analysis and visualization directly on unstructured-grid datasets.
